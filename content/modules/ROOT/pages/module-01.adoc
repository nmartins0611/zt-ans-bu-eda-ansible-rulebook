== Overview

This guide introduces the fundamentals of `ansible-rulebook` and demonstrates how to work with webhook sources. You'll learn about the core components that enable event-driven automation and get hands-on experience with a practical webhook example.

== Rulebook Fundamentals

`ansible-rulebook` relies on three essential components that work together to enable event-driven automation and intelligent responses to system events.

=== Core Components

The three main components of rulebooks are:

**Source**:: The sources of our events come from source plugins. These plugins define where we are listening for events and monitoring system activity.

**Condition**:: The conditional statements in the rulebook allow us to match specific criteria on which we want to trigger a response. These act as filters to determine when actions should be executed.

**Action**:: The action is our response once the condition has been met from the event source. This can include triggering remediation workflows, logging tickets for observation, or generating additional events for further processing.

[NOTE]
====
The list of available source plugins is actively expanding as more partners contribute to the project ecosystem.

=== Available Source Plugins

The following table shows the currently supported source plugins:

|===
| Source Plugin | Description

| Azure Service Bus
| An ansible-rulebook event source module for receiving events from an Azure service bus

| File
| An ansible-rulebook event source plugin for loading facts from YAML files initially and when the file changes

| Kafka
| An ansible-rulebook event source plugin for receiving events via a kafka topic

| Range
| An ansible-rulebook event source plugin for generating events with an increasing index

| URL Check
| An ansible-rulebook event source plugin that polls a set of URLs and sends events with their status

| Webhook
| An ansible-rulebook event source module for receiving events via a webhook

| Watchdog
| An ansible-rulebook event source plugin for watching file system changes

| Alertmanager
| An event source module for receiving events via a webhook from Alertmanager

== Webhook Source Example

This section demonstrates how to implement and test a webhook-based rulebook that responds to HTTP POST requests.

To begin, lets install the ansible.eda collection to access the source plugins:

[source,yaml]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.eda
----


=== Step 1: Examine the Rulebook Structure

. **Navigate to the ansible-rulebook tab** and inspect the sources and rules in `webhook-example.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
cat webhook-example.yml
----

The example demonstrates all three core components mentioned above:

**Source Configuration**:: This specifies which source plugin we are using (webhook plugin in this case):
+
[source,yaml]
----
sources:
  - ansible.eda.webhook:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 5000
----

**Rule Definition**:: The rule provides a conditional statement that looks for a specific message:
+
[source,yaml]
----
rules:
  - name: Say Hello
    condition: event.body.message == "Ansible is super cool"
----

**Action Specification**:: The action defines what happens when the rule condition is met:
+
[source,yaml]
----
action:
  run_playbook:
    name: say-what.yml
----

=== Step 2: Review the Triggered Playbook

. **From the ansible-rulebook**, inspect the `say-what.yml` playbook to understand what will execute when the condition is met.

[source,yaml]
----
cat say-what.yml
----

=== Step 3: Start the Rulebook Engine

Now let's test the webhook functionality:

. **Run the rulebook** from the `ansible-rulebook` tab:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-rulebook --rulebook webhook-example.yml -i inventory.yml --print-events
----

. **Observe the output** showing the initial rulebook being loaded by `ansible-rulebook`, followed by a flashing cursor indicating it's ready to receive events.

=== Step 4: Test Event Processing

Let's trigger some messages and observe the responses:

==== Test 1: Non-matching Message

. **From the terminal tab**, use `curl` to post a message that won't match our condition:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"message\": \"Ansible is alright\"}" 127.0.0.1:5000/endpoint
----

. **From the ansible-rulebook tab**, observe that the message was received but no action was triggered because it didn't match the rule condition.

==== Test 2: Matching Message

. **From the terminal tab**, use `curl` to post a message that matches our condition:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"message\": \"Ansible is super cool\"}" 127.0.0.1:5000/endpoint
----

[WARNING]
====
Ensure the message text matches exactly, including punctuation and capitalization, as the condition performs an exact string comparison.

== Key Takeaways

* **Event-Driven Architecture**: Ansible rulebooks enable reactive automation based on external events
* **Flexible Source Plugins**: Multiple input sources allow integration with various systems and protocols  
* **Conditional Logic**: Rules provide precise control over when actions should be executed
* **Webhook Integration**: HTTP endpoints enable easy integration with web services and applications

== Next Steps

* Explore additional source plugins for your specific use cases
* Create custom conditions with more complex logic
* Develop multi-step playbooks for comprehensive automation workflows
* Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems using the Alertmanager source plugin
